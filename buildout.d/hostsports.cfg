# Hosts and ports for buildout
# ============================

# Host names/IP addresses. See below for corresponding ports.
[hosts]
# The public hostname used in virtual hosting, i.e. the public facing domain
public          = jcr.new.ox.ac.uk

# Note that 127.0.0.1 is used throughout instead of simply "localhost"
# for security reasons: lo interface can have multiple addresses (e.g.
# 127.0.0.1 and ::1) and those host addresses are used to filter
# network traffic (including iptables).

# The host that Apache vhost proxies to
apache-backend   = ${:varnish}
# The hostname/address that Varnish binds to
varnish         = 127.0.0.1
# The hosts that are allowed to issue PURGE reuqests to Varnish
allow-purge     = 127.0.0.1
# The IP address that Varnish proxies to (do not use a hostname)
varnish-backend = 127.0.0.1
# The hostname that HAProxy binds to
haproxy         = 127.0.0.1
# The IP addresses of each Zope instance
instance1       = 127.0.0.1
instance2       = 127.0.0.1
# Where to find the syslog deamon to log to
syslog          = localhost
# The hostname that memcached binds to
memcached       = 127.0.0.1
# The IP address of the RelStorage database
relstorage      = 127.0.0.1
# The hostname that supervisord binds to
supervisor      = 127.0.0.1

# Port corresponding to the hostnames above. Note that to bind to ports
# < 1024, you will need to run ./bin/supervisord as root!
